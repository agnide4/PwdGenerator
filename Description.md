This program is password generator web based app.
It creates passwords based on user options:
          User can choose the password length between 8 and 128 characters
          User can choose any combination of letter (lowercase and uppercase), number and special character
The code is also enhanced to ensure that user input remains in compliance with password rules
          When the user does not choose any option a system alert is generated
          When the user input a number less that 8 or more than 128 for password length a system alert is generated as well
The page does not store generated passwords and you can change value and request new passwords as ypu wish.
